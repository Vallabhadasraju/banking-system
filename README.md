🚀 Successfully Deployed My Smart Banking System Project!

As a fresher, I aimed to move beyond theoretical knowledge and gained hands-on experience by building and deploying a complete Smart Banking System. I used Java Spring Boot, MySQL, and Docker, hosting the project live on Render Cloud.

This end-to-end project provided me with valuable exposure in building, testing, and deploying production-ready software—covering everything from backend logic to cloud infrastructure.


🧠 Project Highlights
-> Replicates real banking operations with a secure, modular architecture and responsive frontend.
-> User registration, login, account management, transactions, and real-time histories and statement download.
-> Secure authentication & authorization.
-> Transaction history with timestamps.
-> Intuitive, user-friendly dashboard.
-> Deployed seamlessly with Docker on Render Cloud.

⚙️ Tech Stack
-> Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Maven
-> Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-> Database: MySQL (migrated to PostgreSQL for deployment)
-> Deployment: Docker, Render Cloud

💡 Lessons Learned
-> REST API design and backend/frontend integration
-> Cloud deployment pipelines and containerization with Docker
-> Efficient management of environment variables and secure configs
-> Debugging deployment issues (database connectivity, CORS, etc.)
-> Transitioned from student to developer—now capable of delivering scalable real-world applications
